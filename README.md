The urgent need for monitoring environmental and urban development impacts due to human activities has underscored the importance of change detection using satellite imagery. Traditional manual methods for comparing historical and present satellite images to identify changes in land cover and land use are not only time-consuming and subjective but also prone to errors. This necessitates the development of automated systems capable of efficiently and accurately detecting and classifying changes, such as urban expansion, deforestation, and the emergence of buildings. These automated systems leverage the advancements in remote sensing, machine learning, and computer vision technologies to analyze satellite imagery from different periods. By automating the process of change detection, these systems offer a scalable, objective, and reliable means of monitoring the Earth's surface. They are crucial for informing policy decisions, guiding urban planning, managing natural resources, and responding to environmental challenges. As such, automated change detection stands at the forefront of modern efforts to mitigate the adverse impacts of human activities on the environment and urban landscapes, embodying a critical tool in the quest for sustainable development and conservation practices.So, by performing the classification and change detection process, the damage done to the earth can be mitigated at certain level.
